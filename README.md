I am confused by the complexity and degree of opinion in the current crop of CI software.  Working on a complex project I found that the degree of opinion was so severe that I spent too much time fighting with the CI server and how they wanted to structure my builds and my pipelines.  So, in frustration, I dumped the CI servers and went back to basics - cron and a set of bash and ruby scripts.
